# Initial requirements
This is a screenshot of a mockup for my future application. It looks similar to a Kanban board. It has columns with cards. Each column is devided in 3 rows. Cards can be modev between the columnd and between the rows. I need a code to implement this interface.

## Implementation plan

key features:
### Core Functionality:

- **Drag & Drop:** Cards can be moved between any column and row
- **Visual Feedback:** Drop zones highlight when dragging over them
- **Structured Layout:** Each column has exactly 3 rows as shown in your mockup

### Features Included:

- Priority indicators (High Priority in red)
- Category tags with different colors (Research, Design, Backend, etc.)
- Due dates with calendar icons
- Checkboxes for task completion
- "Add task" buttons in each row
- Responsive design with horizontal scrolling

### Technical Implementation:

- Uses React hooks for state management
- Implements HTML5 drag and drop API
- Stores all data in component state (no localStorage as per requirements)
- Styled with Tailwind CSS for consistent appearance

The interface closely matches your mockup with the same card content, categories, and visual styling. You can drag any card to any row in any column, and the board will update accordingly. The "Add task" functionality is ready to be connected to your backend or expanded with a modal for task creation.
